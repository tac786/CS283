NOTES:
1. No Code in dsh_cli.c 
2. Fork/exec pattern to execute external commands
3. Move dragon extra credit to dragon.c 
4. Not implement pipe splitting
5. Single cmd_buff type at a time
6. Not use the command_list_t
7. Fork/exec pattern requires the use of conditional branching logic to implement the child path and the parent path in the code.
8. Use execvp() to search the PATH variable locations for binaries
9. Use WEXITSTATUS to extract the status code from the child process

- Use dshlib.h for useful definitions and types to make work easier
- Implement 'cd' in dshlib.c 
- Build upon the code from last week
